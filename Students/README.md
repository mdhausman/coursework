#Students.java

A (very) simple application for managing student data.

Created for a course homework assignment, this program was made the official 
solution.

##What do I need to run it?

I wouldn't advise running it. Not without some modification of the ORACLE_SERVER
and ORACLE_SERVER_SID constants. And, of course, a SQL database to connect to. 
And possibly minor tweaks to getConnection().

##Why is it here?

Because I enjoyed writing it.
